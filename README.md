# aws-svc
1. You will need to create aws free tier account.
2. Next you will need to create a vm using EC2 while creation make sure you allow all inbound traffics.
3. Next you will need RDS postgresql make sure the you allow public access to it and also add security group with all inbound traffic.
4. Make sure your connections work from your local system using ping command in command prompt.
5. If it works you will need to take your code to your ec2 vm via git but before you will need to install git, openjdk and maven.
6. i have created a run.sh shell script to reduce my efforts.
7. Enjoy!!! And let me know if any issues.
